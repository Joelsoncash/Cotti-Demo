Grammar: Pronoun-Verb Agreement • Remember that a present-tense verb must agree with its pronoun subject. • With the pronouns I, we, you, and they, do not add -s to most action verbs to form the present tense. We visit your garden. You show us around. I pick some tomatoes. They taste great! Circle the pronoun in ( ) that agrees with the verb in each sentence. 1. (You, She) enjoy gardening. 2. (We, He) think your garden is lovely. 3. What kind of fl owers do (you, she) grow? 4. (I, He) see red roses. 5. (It, They) grow so tall! 6. How do (she, you) grow such pretty fl owers? 7. (I, He) want to take some fl owers home.
